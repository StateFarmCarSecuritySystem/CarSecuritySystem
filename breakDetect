/*This code initializes that we want our code to be called break, and has our input from the conductive gel/window to be on pin 4.
when the pulse in for four from a higher energy source than usual (after a 5 second delay) goes past 45 seconds (50 seconds in total),
the code should activate pin 8 to output a voltage.*/
